// Button was not required, but I added it to make the form look complete.

import React from "react";

export default class LoginButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <br />
        <button id="log-in-btn">LOG IN</button>
        <br />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
